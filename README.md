# Sentiment-Analysis-via-CNN-BiLSTM
The Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture devised a strategy of studying from home via online or remotely in 2020, in response to the increasing spread of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). From offline to online learning, there has been a significant change in the way people learn. During the coronavirus pandemic, the number of people using educational platforms increased dramatically.

This project contains a sentiment analysis of the Quipper edutech application review taken from the google play store. This project uses the CNN-BiLSTM method and produces a fairly high accuracy.
This code includes dataset upload, preprocessing, tokenization and pad sequencing, hyperparameter tuning for the CNN-BiLSTM model using bayesian optimization, and predicting new data.
